Empoleon @ Choice Scarf
Ability: Torrent
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
Timid / Modest Nature
- Flash Cannon
- Ice Beam
- Grass Knot / Hidden Power [Flying]
- Hydro Pump / Surf

So, Choice Scarf with Timid Nature make his speed 300, or with Modest, his Speed reaches 274. Both are good for Empoleon. Scald is another option for 3 vs 3 battles, but since most of them are 1 vs 1, I prefer Surf/Hydro Pump.

I use this set for my Empoleon lead.

Empoleon (M) @ Focus Sash
Ability: Torrent
EVs: 128 Def / 252 SpA / 128 SpD
Modest Nature
- Hidden Power [Fire]
- Surf
- Ice Beam
- Stealth Rock

Most leads are now Fire-type Pokemon, or carry a Fire type move, because of Scizor and Forretress abuse. However, with this going on, there is almost NO Scizor and Forretress abuse, so now it's mostly Fire types. Empoleon can sweep out Fire types. With Hidden Power [Fire], he can cover Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Scizor, Ice Beam for any Dragons that come into the picture, while being able to set up Rocks.

Empoleon @ Choice Specs
Ability: Torrent
EVs: 128 HP / 252 SpA / 128 Spe
Modest Nature
IVs: 0 Atk
- Flash Cannon / Toxic / Stealth Rock
- Ice Beam
- Grass Knot
- Hydro Pump / Surf

Hydro Pump is nice STAB, and packs quite a punch with Specs and a respectable base SpA of 111, but Surf can be used for a more reliable alternative.
Ice Beam hits Grass types who are eager to switch in to take the Water type STAB and rounds out the coverage nicely.
Grass Knot hits other Water types like Milotic.
Flash Cannon is also STAB, and can get some extra neutral coverage, while Stealth Rock can be used to scout and at the same time supporting the team.
Toxic can be used to cripple walls Empoleon just can't get through.
The speed EVs are to outspeed base 75, like Claydol, and below who don't invest in speed by 2 points just incase they invest 4 in Speed and SpA is then maximized for obvious reasons namely to make it do most possible damage while the rest is thrown into HP for some extra bulk.
This Empoleon can be quite a nasty surprise for Pokes who try to taunt it.

Gen VI

Empoleon @ Assault Vest
Ability: Torrent
EVs: 96 Def / 252 SpA / 162 SpD
Modest Nature
- Scald
- Flash Cannon
- Grass Knot
- Ice Beam

I love the typing on this guy. Scald is STAB and has a chance to burn, helping your defenses. Flash Cannon is STAB and is super effective against the new Fairy-types, who usually appear as special attackers (Sylveon, Florges, etc). Ice Beam is coverage, so is Grass Knot.

Defensive:

King Pingu (Empoleon) @ Leftovers
Ability: Torrent
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD
Calm Nature
- Stealth Rock
- Roar
- Toxic
- Scald

Stealth Rock is... well... Stealth Rock, and Roar gets boosts off of opposing Pokemon as well as forces them to take damage from Stealth Rock. Scald is a nice source of damage, and if you can burn the opponent's physical attackers, your Empoleon will becom annoyingly hard to take out. Toxic provides a nice constant source of damage.

It's a pretty odd moveset, but it works.

Empoleon @ Leftovers
Ability: Defiant
EVs: 252 HP / 128 Def / 128 SpD
Bold Nature
- Bide
- Aqua Ring
- Whirlpool
- Steel Wing

So Bide is a pretty powerful move. Take 2 hits and it unleashes twice the damage taken.
If there is a sweeper, lock them into Whirlpool. They can't switch out. you could use Shadow Tag Wobbuffet and replace Whirlpool for Swords Dance. Aqua Ring and Leftovers for recovery, and Steel Wing for pesky Ghost-types.

Physical set

Empoleon (F) @ Life Orb
Ability: Defiant
EVs: 252 Atk / 252 Spe
Adamant Nature
- Waterfall
- Drill Peck
- Earthquake
- Swords Dance

Waterfall - STAB, good power, chance to flinch foe.
Drill Peck - Good power, covers weaknesses.
Earthquake - Great power, covers weakness.
Swords Dance - Sharply raises attack.

This set is pretty legit. It does some serious damage, pretty standard but effective, all weaknesses covered. Plus, Empoleon is pretty sturdy, so this allows the user a turn to set up at least. It makes for a pretty powerful Empoleon.

OR

Special set

Empoleon (F) @ Wise Glasses
Ability: Torrent
EVs: 252 SpA / 252 Spe
Modest Nature
- Scald
- Hidden Power [Ground]
- Ice Beam
- Flash Cannon

Scald - STAB, good power, and a chance to burn the foe.
Hidden Power [Ground] - covers weaknesses.
Ice Beam - Coverage and good power, and a chance to freeze foe.
Flash Cannon - STAB, good power, and a chance to lower foe's Special Defense.

This set works well too, though you might have a problem against Fighting types. If trained properly, you could probably knock out the Fighting Pokemon in a shot, as most Fighting Pokemon have atrocious Special Defense stats.

Physical Moveset
Empoleon (M) @ Mystic Water

Ability: Torrent
EVs: 252 Atk / 70 Def / 20 SpD / 160 Spe
Adamant Nature
- Swords Dance
- Waterfall
- Drill Peck
- Earthquake

Swords Dance: Combined with full attack EVs, this enables Empoleon to do some serious damage.

Waterfall: Covers Ground weakness, as well as Fire-types & Roc-typesk. Also good as at low health. STAB, Mystic Water, and Torrent combined with a pretty solid power of 80, along with 252 Attack EVs, can pack an extremely powerful punch.

Drill Peck: Covers Fighting-type weakness, as well as Grass-types & Bug-types.

Earthquake: Raw power. Covers Electric weakness, as well as Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel.

Hope this helps you as much as it did me!

Empoleon (M) @ Petaya Berry
Ability: Torrent
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
Modest Nature
- Substitute
- Agility
- Brine
- Ice Beam

The SubPetaya set is one of my favorite movesets. The trick to using this set is to use Agility when you predict your opponent will switch out. That way, Empoleon can outspeed a handful of Pokémon (with the exception of Choice Scarf users). Then, you spam Substitute until your HP goes low enough to activate the Petaya Berry (which at the same time will trigger both Torrent and Brine's 130 power). After all these boosts, Empoleon is ready to sweep and can dominate the arena.

brine stays at 65 base power unless the opponent has 50% or less remaining HP. Hydro Pump is the best choice for water STAB

Special Attack Sweeper

Empoleon (F) @ Sitrus Berry
Ability: Torrent
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
Modest Nature
- Scald
- Flash Cannon
- Ice Beam
- Agility

Scald (STAB, burn chance, for Rock, Ground and Fire types)
Flash Cannon (STAB, for Fairy and Ice types)
Ice Beam (for Grass, Flying and Dragon types, freeze chance)
AGILITY (this is your game changer, risky but perfect timing can sweep at least 3 Pokemon. Sitrus Berry for instant healing, just wish that they wont 1 hit KO you with Earthquake or Close Combat LOL)

Empoleon

Standard Power Trip Set

Empoleon @ Weakness Policy
Ability: Defiant
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
Jolly Nature / Adamant Nature
- Swords Dance
- Agility
- Power Trip
- Substitute / Aqua Jet

Swords Dance and Agility are setups for Power Trip, in addition to the Weakness Policy that will boost Power Trip even further when hit with a super effective move. Power Trip is for high damage, that can KO anything easily with stat boosts. Substitute can be used to take an extra hit/activate Weakness Policy, and Aqua Jet can be used for priority/coverage, if you aren't able to get off an Agility.

You can invest more EVs in HP from Atk EVs for a Substitute,

This is for a tank with some decent recovery

Empoleon @ Leftovers
Ability: Torrent
EVs: 180 Def / 252 SpA / 76 SpD
- Surf
- Ice Beam
- Grass Knot
- Aqua Ring

Moves:
Surf: STAB
Ice Beam: Coverage
Grass Knot: Cover Water types
Aqua Ring: Paired with Leftovers, gives 1/8 HP per turn

Could throw in Flash Cannon instead of Surf or Ice Beam for different STAB move, also could swap Aqua Ring for Rest

Game Mode: Platinum

Empoleon @ Splash Plate / Sea Incense
Ability: Torrent
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
Modest Nature
- Surf
- Flash Cannon
- Ice beam
- Grass Knot / Drill Peck

Surf (STAB - Water) - HM from Cynthia’s GrandMa
Flash Cannon (STAB - Steel) - obtained after defeating the 6th Gym
Ice Beam (Coverage) - Grass, Ground, and Dragon types. Found in Route 216.
Grass Knot / Drill Peck (Coverage) - Grass Knot is obtained after defeating the 2nd Gym. Drill Peck is learned via level up that handles fighting types. It’s also here in case you don’t want grass knot as your final move.

Note: Earthquake is not here because Empoleon is a special attacker, but you can teach it to Empoleon if you don’t have anyone else in your team to teach Earthquake. It’s found in Wayward Cave.

Item: Splash Plate (Route 219) / Sea Incense (Route 204)

Support mon:

Empoleon @ Leftovers
Ability: Torrent
EVs: 248 HP / 64 SpAtk / 16 Def / 180 SpDef
Modest Nature
- Scald
- Toxic
- Protect
- Defog

I like using this mon for support. Scald is used to cripple physical attackers, toxic is to apply status and to cripple a mon, protect is to stay alive another turn and defog is to take out hazards, which is good because empoleon does not take toxic spikes damage and very limited stealth rocks and spikes damage, making it the perfect defogger.

Best set for Empoleon

Empoleon @ Life Orb
Ability: Torrent / Defiant
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
Modest / Timid Nature
- Flash Cannon
- Hydro Pump / Surf
- Ice Beam
- Agility / Hidden Power [Fire]

This Special Sweeper set is very good, and is almost as good as Mega Manectric. I recommend Torrent for the Ability, since the Attack from Defiant won't be very useful for a Special attacker.
